# maubot-events
A maubot plugin that helps facilitate Fedora virtual events that are run through Matrix

The code for this bot was originally based on the [maubot-pagure-notifications](https://github.com/fedora-infra/maubot-pagure-notifications) codebase due its implementation of similar features (i.e. handling webhooks).
